For the solid body rotation in a plane test case I am using the setup:

Domain size 100mx100m with 100x100 cells
End time pi/8
Time step pi/8000 (to give a maximum Courant number of 0.609469)
I guess that you used a time-step of pi/800

Centre of rotation at x_c = (50,50)
A = 8 /s
for defining the streamfunction using 
psi = A |x - x_c|^2
(where x is the position vector)
This gives very large winds, of the order 800m/s

Initial tracer concentration:

phi = exp(-0.5 |x-x'|^2/9)
where x' is the vector location of the initial centre of the tracer given by
x' = x_c + r' (cos(theta0), sin(theta0))
where r' = 30*sqrt(2) = 42.426406871
and theta0 = pi/4

This differs from what is in your MSc thesis because you don't have a minus in the exponential and you defined r'=2*sqrt(30)

Where did you get this setup from? Did you define the numbers to make it look similar to Leonard et al 1996? Or are these numbers defined somewhere.

Alternative, equivalent setup:
    Multiply times by 8000/pi
    Multiply length by 100
    Multiply speeds by 100*pi/8000
    Multiply A by pi/8000
End time 1000
Time step 1
write every 10
Domain size 1e4 x 1e4
Centre of rotaion (5e3, 5e3)
A = 0.00314159265 = pi/1000
r' = 30*sqrt(2)*100 = 4,242.640687119
# try instead:
r' = 25*sqrt(2)*100 = 3,535.533905933
# to avoid interactions with boundaries
tracer radius = 300
